# DNNROIFinding

Applies a deep-neural-network ROI finder to deconvolved wire-plane traces by running them through a TorchScript model and produces a new frame with signal-processed charge traces.

## Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `anode` | type/name of the IAnodePlane that defines the channel range (default "AnodePlane") |
| `plane` | wire-plane index (0=U, 1=V, 2=W) selecting which channels to process (default 0) |
| `forward` | type/name of the ITensorForward service running the model (default "TorchService") |
| `intags` | array of input trace tags fed as network input channels (required) |
| `decon_charge_tag` | trace tag for the deconvolved charge used as the signal source after ROI masking (required) |
| `outtag` | output trace tag applied to the resulting signal traces |
| `input_scale` | scale factor applied uniformly to all input charge values before the model (default 1/4000); set to 1.0 when the TorchScript model bakes per-channel normalization internally (e.g. 6-channel models) |
| `input_offset` | constant offset added to input charge values after scaling (default 0.0) |
| `output_scale` | scale factor applied to output charge after ROI masking (default 1.0) |
| `tick0` | first tick index of the data window (default 0) |
| `nticks` | number of ticks in the data window (default 6000) |
| `mask_thresh` | probability threshold for converting the network ROI mask to binary (default 0.5) |

## Input Normalization

Before being passed to the model, all input channels are transformed uniformly:

```
model_input = raw_charge * input_scale + input_offset
```

The location of normalization depends on the model:

- **3-channel models** — normalization is external: set `input_scale = 1/4000` (the default) so C++ scales the charge before inference.
- **6-channel models** — per-channel z-score normalization is baked into the TorchScript graph itself, so `input_scale` should be `1.0` (pass-through) and the model handles the rest internally.

The `DNNROIFindingMultiPlane` variant follows the same convention.
